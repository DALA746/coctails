# Fancy Coctails with React & Tailwind CSS🍹

For this project, I used [The CoctailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) and coded the whole project in React using React Hooks including useState, useEffect, useContext, etc. For styling, I used Tailwind CSS library. This project goal was to dive into TailwindCSS and learn more about it.

I learned how to set up/connect Taiwind to the project, use the configuration file for custom styling, and how to style responsive webpages with Tailwind. Would I use Taiwind again for my future projects 🤔? Yes, I would!

The whole styling experience was really fast and effective 🏃‍♀️ and I didn't have to spend time coming up with class names 😜. The possibility for customization and building project fast is the reason I would choose this library again for my next projects 👍.

I really had fun with this project 😄. I had the vision to create a digital cocktail book so people could visit this site and find some inspiring cocktail recipes for their parties.🍹

I am open for feedback if you have any suggestions about code or design or if you find any bugs please report me so I can fix them. 😁
