# Fancy Coctails with React & Tailwind CSSüçπ

For this project, I used [The CoctailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) and integrated it into a React application using React Hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useContext. I chose Tailwind CSS for styling, using this project as an opportunity to explore its features.

The main focus was on learning how to set up and configure Tailwind, customize the styling through the configuration file, and build responsive web pages.
Would I use Tailwind again? Absolutely! Its fast and efficient styling workflow, combined with its flexibility, makes it my go-to choice for future projects.
