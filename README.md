For this project I used CoctailDB Api, coded whole project in React using React Hooks included useState, useEffext, useContext. For styling I used Tailwind CSS library. This project goal was to dive into Tailwind and learn more about it.

I learned how to set up/connect Taiwind to the project, use cofiguration file for custom style, use short name of classes. Would I use Taiwind again for my future projects? Yes, for some project not for all.

What I love most about Tailwind, it is fast to build project, it was easy to set up. Tailwind deploys everything fast and delete all unnececery classes. This is was my first time using useContent. I think it was easy to use and a great alternative for other statemagment tools such as Redux.

I really had fun with this project. I had a vision to create a digital coctail book so people could visit my site and maybe find an inpirations for for coctails to make before party.
