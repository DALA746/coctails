# Fancy Coctails with React & Tailwind CSSüçπ
For this project, I used [The CoctailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/)  and integrated it into React using React Hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext. I chose Tailwind CSS for styling, using the project as an opportunity to explore its features.

The main focus was on learning how to set up and connect Tailwind, utilize the configuration file for personalized styling, and create responsive webpages. Would I use Tailwind again? Absolutely! Its speedy and effective styling process, combined with customization flexibility, makes it my go-to for future projects.

Styling was quick, and the absence of the need to brainstorm class names saved time. The library's capability for rapid project development reinforces my decision to use it again. Envisioned as a digital cocktail book, this project seeks to inspire users with creative cocktail recipes for their social gatherings.
