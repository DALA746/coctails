For this project I used CoctailDB Api, coded whole project in React using React Hooks included useState, useEffext, useContext. For styling I used Tailwind CSS library. This project goal was to give into Tailwind and learn more about it.

What I love most about Tailwind, it is fast to build project, it was easy to set up. Tailwind deploys everything fast and delete all unnececery classes. This is was my first time using useContent. I think it was easy to use and a great alternative for other statemagment tools such as Redux.
